# Discrete-black-and-white-TO-with-SA
This is a code for replicating results of a paper entitlred ''A New Non-Gradient-Based Topology Optimization Algorithm with Black-White Density and Manufacturability Constraints''
Run the Code TO(Nelx, Nely, N, vol) as a function with input parameters of classic cantilever beam topology optimization problem
Nelx= number of elements in x-direction
Nely= number of elements in y-direction
N= number of iterations in each tempertature of simulated annealing 
vol= volume fraction of the final solution
The problem can be changed to MB beam just by changing boundry conditions in lines 103-108
